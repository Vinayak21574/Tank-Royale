Tank Royale is a Game development project for AP (Advanced Programming) created using JAVA and LibGdx, a cross-platform game development framework. The game is a two-player, turn-based tank fighting game where you can choose your tank and jump to the battlefield, move your tank (until the fuel runs out), aim at your opponent's tank, and fire rockets to decimate your opponent's tankâ€”the one to shoot down the opponent's tank first wins. 

This game also allows the users to pause and save the game to resume whenever they want. The game is implemented by using most of the Object Oriented Programming principles like encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, and following various design principles. 

To run the game, you would have to install Java and LibGdx. Then download the game folder, extract all its files, go to the desktop folder src->com->mygdx->game, and run the DesktopLauncher.java file.
